1. Problem Statement Classification of given genetic variations/mutations based on text-evidence into 9 types of mutations (multi-class classification problem)
1.1 Performance Metric
Metircs: Multi Class log-loss Confusion Matrix
1.2 Machine learning Objectives/Constraints
Objective: Predict the probability of each data-point belonging to each of the nine classes for better interpretation Constraints:
Interpretability Class probabilities are needed. Penalize the errors in class probabilites => Metric is Log-loss. No Latency constraints.
